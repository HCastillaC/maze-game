# Maze Game

This is a simple maze game, in which your objective is to navigate through a maze using WASD controls, towards the exit of the maze.

## Controls

This game is based on text, so, to enter an input, you must press any of the WASD keys, depending of the direction you wish to move to, and the press enter.

This is due to my limited knowledge about C++, and also because I cannot be less bothered to learn how to make normal controls right now.
